# SpatialHashGrid

A Swift playground for experimenting with broad-phase collision grids, moving platforms, and now configurable AI enemies. The demo app shows:

- A kinematic player controller riding moving platforms.
- Configurable enemies with patrols, chase/flee behaviours, and ranged/melee attacks.
- Map editor tooling that lets you drop those enemies on the grid, tweak movement (including wall-bounce paths), behaviours, attacks, and gravity, all with live visual feedback.
- SpriteKit and SwiftUI renderers built on top of the same physics core.

See `Docs/SpatialHashGrid.md` for a deeper overview.
